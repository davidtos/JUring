# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone!  
Every change, big or small, is welcome as long as it contributes to the goal of creating the fastest bindings to io_uring.

The main criteria for a PR are:
- The code should look reasonably good and follow a consistent style.
- It should not hurt performance.

You're encouraged to run the benchmarks before submitting a PR, but don't worry, we'll run them as well before merging to see how things change for better or worse.

## For those new to this project, topic, or open source

If you don't have much experience with OSS, io_uring, native bindings, or Java, and that's stopping you from contributing even though you're really interested in the project, feel free to reach out! Everyone has to start somewhere, and we're happy to help you get involved.
